"""
Exercise 1:
Use python builtin methods to print the length of the string.
"""
# x = "Hello World"
#
#
#
# print(len(x))

"""
Exercise 2:
Get the first character of the string txt and print it.
"""
# txt = "Hello World"
#
# print(x[0])
"""
Exercise 3:
Get the characters from index 2 to index 4 (llo).
"""
# txt = "Hello World"
#
# x[2:5]

"""
Exercise 4:
Use one of string builtin methods(functions like string.capitalize()) to return the string 
without any whitespace at the beginning or the end.
"""

txt = " Hello World "

print(txt.replace(" ", ""))



"""
Exercise 5:
Convert x into a floating point number and into string print the values.
"""
x = 5

x = float(x)
print(type(x))
print(x)

x = str(x)
print(type(x))
print(x)

"""
Exercise 6:
Print the data type of the following variables.
"""

my_txt = "Hello"
print(type(my_txt))
my_num = 8
print(type(my_num))
my_float = 8.8
print(type(my_float))
my_bool = True
print(type(my_bool))

"""
After completing all the exercises save the file and send the result via Slack personal massage.
