"""
Exercise 1: Below are the two lists convert it into the dictionary.
"""

# keys = ["Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty"]
# values = [10, 20, 30]
#
# dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
# print(dict)




"""
Exercise 2:
Access the value of key "history" from the below dict
"""
sampleDict = {
    "class": {"student": {"name": "Mike", "marks": {"physics": 70, "history": 80}}}
}

keys = sampleDict.keys()
values = sampleDict.values()
print(keys)
print(values)





"""
Exercise 3:
Create a new dictionary by extracting the following keys from a below dictionary
"""
sampleDict = {"name": "Kelly", "age": 25, "salary": 8000, "city": "New york"}
# Keys to extract
keys = ["name", "salary"]

# Expected output: {'name': 'Kelly', 'salary': 8000}

# code goes here

"""
Exercise 4:
Slice list into 3 equal chunks and reverse each chunk
"""
sample_list = [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]

# code goes here



"""
Exercise 5:
Write a program to iterate a given list and count
the occurrence of each element and create a dictionary 
to show the count of each element.
"""
sample_list = [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89]

# Expected Outcome: Printing count of each item  {11: 2, 45: 3, 8: 1, 23: 2, 89: 1}

# code goes here

"""
Exercise 6:
Sort the list items by accending order without using list special methods like 'sort()'.
"""

my_list = [5,8,1,6,4,9,7,2,3]
