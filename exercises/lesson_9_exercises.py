congratulations to the winner, 
and ask if the players want to start a new game).

Exercise 2:
Generate a random number or set it by yourself.
between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). 
Ask the user to guess the number, 
then tell them whether they guessed too low, 
too high, or exactly right. 
(Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

Extras:

Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, 
and when the game ends, print this out.
