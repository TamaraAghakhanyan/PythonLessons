Exercise 5:
Define a function named even_numbers that takes in a list of numbers
as an argument and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. 
For example, even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return [2, 4].

Exercise 6:
Define a function named word_count that takes in a string and returns a dictionary
where the keys are each word in the string and the values are the number of times 
that word appears in the string. 
For example, word_count('the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog') should return a dictionary like this:

{
  'the': 2,
  'quick': 1,
  'brown': 1,
  'fox': 1,
  'jumps': 1,
  'over': 1,
  'lazy': 1,
  'dog': 1
}
